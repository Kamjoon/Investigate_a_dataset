# Data-Analysis_Python3

This is a Data Analysis project that reviews the data from a study in Brazil that recorded Patient Appointment information. 

I decided to focus on different on 2 questions: 

1 - Is there a correlation between no show appointments and socioeconmic status?
2 - Which patient characteristic is the strongest indicator a patient will show up to an appointment?

Answers are revealed during the exploratory section.
